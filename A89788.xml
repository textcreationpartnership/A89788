            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Catechizing</hi> is <hi>a branch</hi> of <hi>Preaching,</hi> as was ſaid; Two things there are in it peculiar, which <hi>eminently</hi> commend this courſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The Subject Matter; It is <hi>converſant</hi> about ſuch <hi>Truths,</hi> as being <hi>moſt neceſſary</hi> to <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170378:4"/>
are ſo to our hand laid down in Scripture, as <hi>Milk</hi> is in nature, which taken in from the <hi>breast,</hi> and with leaſt Cookery and dreſſing, is moſt wholeſome; It is our firſt food, and with ſuch truths our inſtruction muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity begin. The Church of God, in the daies of <hi>Adam, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch, Noah, &amp;c.</hi> its firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, had little other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but of ſuch plain truths; Afterwards a further acceſſion of light was brought them by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. Yet then, as <hi>David</hi> tells us, The Ignorant muſt have of theſe eaſie truths, for entrance and initiation;<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.130.</note> 
               <hi>The</hi> entrance <hi>of thy Word giveth light to the</hi> ſimple.
<pb facs="tcp:170378:4"/>
There was an Infancy alſo of the Church after Chriſt; the Apoſtle in that age of it did for the moſt part teach the people ſuch fundamentals onely, the ſumme whereof was, as <hi>Act.</hi> 20.21. <hi>Repentance toward God, and Faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and in ſo doing hee tells them, <hi>hee kept back nothing that was</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable <hi>to them;</hi> though hee had higher <hi>wiſdome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.6</note> which <hi>hee ſpake among them that were perfect,</hi> and more knowing. <hi>As a wiſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-builder, hee laid the foundation;</hi> this hee did at his firſt coming to them, afterwards by his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, hee builds them up fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>leaving the Principles of the Doctrine of Christ; let us</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>go on to perfection, and this
<pb facs="tcp:170378:5"/>
will wee do if God permit,</hi> Heb. 6.1.13.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Manner, which is ſo to <hi>inſtruct,</hi> as to require a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal account</hi> of what is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and remembred by them that are <hi>taught,</hi> whereas in <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> there is liberty for the moſt part, left to the <hi>hearer,</hi> whether hee will <hi>heed</hi> or not: but this kind of <hi>Instruction</hi> is ordinarily ſo managed, as to leave ſome kinde of greater <hi>neceſsity</hi> in the <hi>hearer</hi> to <hi>attend</hi> and obſerve <hi>what</hi> is ſaid unto <hi>him,</hi> each perſon for <hi>himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is incredible how little, poor <hi>Ignorant</hi> ſouls, attend the <hi>doctrinal part</hi> of a <hi>Sermon:</hi> when in the <hi>Application</hi> their <hi>Morals</hi> are dealt with, their <hi>Adultery,
<pb facs="tcp:170378:5"/>
Drunkenneſſe, Swearing, Sabbath-breaking,</hi> and the like groſs ſins; poſſibly there is ſome little <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> at leaſt as they are the ſins of others, which corrupt nature is pleaſed as well to <hi>hear,</hi> as to <hi>ſpeak</hi> of.</p>
            <p>A <hi>diſcourſe</hi> of <hi>Navigation,</hi> to a company of men, whoſe <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> and <hi>profeſſion</hi> is to <hi>till</hi> the Earth, will bee little <hi>heeded,</hi> or in the leaſt able to draw their minds from what their preſent <hi>thoughts</hi> are ſet <hi>upon:</hi> But if there bee an <hi>acquaintance</hi> with the loweſt <hi>Elements</hi> of a <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> wee will of our ſelves with <hi>delight</hi> attend to the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>higher Secrets</hi> and Myſteries thereof. There is a <hi>neceſſity</hi> therefore in a more
<pb facs="tcp:170378:6"/>
familiar way to indeavour that each mans ſoul in <hi>particular</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our charge bee brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>acquaintance</hi> with the <hi>Elements</hi> and firſt <hi>Principles of</hi> Religion, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe your moſt conſtant and frequent <hi>hearers</hi> will ſit at <hi>Sermons</hi> as thoſe,<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.31.</note> 
               <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. <hi>they ſit before thee as my people, &amp;c.</hi> Or if they do <hi>attend;</hi> for want of ſuch <hi>praecognita</hi> or <hi>preparative</hi> light, they profit little, by much and frequent <hi>hearing;</hi> They may grow up in an <hi>overlie</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded <hi>knowledge, bee ever learning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim 37</note> 
               <hi>yet never bee able to come to ſuch ſolid knowledge of the Truth,</hi> as will preſerve their ſouls from the <hi>luſts</hi> that are within, or <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers</hi> without.</p>
            <p>Now, by how much the
<pb facs="tcp:170378:6"/>
more <hi>excellent</hi> and neceſſary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ordinance is found to be, by ſo much the more <hi>watchful</hi> and induſtrious, Satan &amp; his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have alwaies been to clog it with ſome Ceremony or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional of their own, that they may be ſwallowed together, as, the <hi>Apocripha</hi> with the <hi>Bible,</hi> which if it had gone forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, by it ſelf, or with ſome other book, it would never have gained ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, or ſo <hi>ſacred</hi> an eſteem generally with men; ſo <hi>kneeling</hi> was added to the Lords Supper, the <hi>Croſſe</hi> to Baptiſm, a <hi>Surpleſſe</hi> to our publick worſhip, a ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and <hi>limited form</hi> of words to our prayers; &amp; the like attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this <hi>CASE.</hi> If any man hereupon
<pb facs="tcp:170378:7"/>
ſcrupling theſe Formes and Ceremonies, withdraw from thoſe excellent Ordinances, though upon <hi>that account</hi> only, as many in all ages have done: yet ſhall they ſuffer under the reproach of deſpiſing Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the unqueſtionable duties of a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>The Lord having now (by very ſtrange turnings of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) called in to place thoſe Honourable <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes,</hi> the great Reformers in matters of Religion, who have by their <hi>care</hi> and vigilance, done more herein, than ever was by any Parliament ſince Popery hath been rejected, The <hi>Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Counſellor,</hi> wee hope in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will ſtill guide them, and all
<pb facs="tcp:170378:7"/>
Parliaments hereafter by their example, <hi>to carry on</hi> this work of Reformation with like <hi>modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as hath been hitherto the progeſs of it.</p>
            <p>It will prove a great burden, and become an endleſs ſtrife and contention in the Churches of Chriſt, If <hi>Magistrates</hi> or <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods</hi> ſhall impoſe with heavy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, <hi>every</hi> ſuch practice and obſervance as poſſibly they may <hi>conceive</hi> to bee <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>uſeful</hi> for the better or more ſolemn performance of the ſervice and worſhip of God. That <hi>Synod</hi> in the year, 1640. which was <hi>rigid</hi> and <hi>impoſing</hi> enough, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth a remarkable moderation in their ſeventh Canon. A practice they endeavour there, to
<pb facs="tcp:170378:8"/>
bring into the Church; which they profeſs to be <hi>pious in it ſelf, profitable unto us, and edifying unto others,</hi> yet notwithſtanding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn it not, much leſs under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny penalty; but, <hi>think it very meet and behoveful, and heartily commend it to all good and well-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected people, members of this Church, it being an ancient and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable cuſtome.</hi> And with this imitable moderation and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs conclude the Canon in theſe words. <hi>And in the practice or omiſſion of this right, wee deſire that the Rule of Charity preſcribed by the Apoſtle, may bee obſerved, which is, That they which uſe this Rite, deſpiſe not them that uſe it not, and they that uſe it not, condemn not them that uſe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:170378:8"/>Such a Chriſtian charity and tenderneſs in <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Synods</hi> in reſpect to Rites and Obſervances, or matters of like nature, not evidently neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to the worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God: is all this little <hi>Treatiſe</hi> humbly pleads for.</p>

and his ſpiritual Kingdome are from himſelf, who onely knows himſelf, and what will bee for his honour, and the edification of his people, upon this account the Lord fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the Scripture giveth charge to Princes, as well as others,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.2</note> not to adde too, nor take from his Law, or to do the thing that ſeemeth good in their own eies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though a Chriſtian, yet hee cannot ſo wel by his wiſdome judge in the matters of Piety what is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, as a Heathen can judge in matters of Civility what is ſutable to man.</p>

When Chriſt hath ſufficiently inſtructed his ſcribe and taken off his hand, as being able now to form his own work, for the Magiſtrate, or a Synod, to take him into tutorage, to adde more ſafe and particular rules and Laws for the direction of the Miniſters of

                  <p>After Chriſt hath given his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters a Book (as before) the Scriptures, and given it to this end that they may be perfect,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16, 17.</note> and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly furniſhed to all imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yet others are not ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he muſt have another Book, a <hi>Prayer</hi> book, and another Book, an inſtructing or preaching Book, a <hi>Catechiſme</hi> book; and to the ſame end, that hee may bee better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for his work, that by this means it may bee done more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, more to edification, as the Common Prayer-book formerly.

the ſame place, <hi>It is the proper Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt to be the Teacher of his Church,</hi> and therefore <hi>no writings may bee appointed to bee read in the Congregation for</hi> inſtruction, <hi>but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as have been indited by his Spirit.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cartw.</hi> in <hi>Cat.</hi> maketh it a breach of the Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and againſt Doctor <hi>Whitg.</hi> about reading of Homilies in the Church hee writeth thus; <hi>Neither the Homilies, nor the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cripha are to bee read at all in the Church.

There is an uniformity ariſing from the vertue of internal principles, as alſo from an external mould or frame, the one is <hi>free</hi> and natural, the other compelled and <hi>forced.</hi> Uniformity from internal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is an excellency in Nature, and in Grace alſo. That an Acorn, a grain of Corn, a Kernel, a ſeed, from each a Body, and in its kinde the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170378:35"/>
like; the like leaf, bark, branch, fruit; it is true, not in ſmaller things ſo exact in likeneſſe as what you caſt in the ſame mould, yet for ſubſtance, and in the maine they are the ſame; all Vines, Cedars, every Plant, and every Herb in its kind, every Beaſt, and every Bird in its kind. And ſo is it with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and holy men, being <hi>a holy Seed,</hi> and having this <hi>Seed remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in them,</hi> their converſation for the ſubſtance is the ſame, and ſo viſibly, <hi>uniforme,</hi> and the ſame, as the blinde World can diſtinguiſh them from other men.</p>
                  <p>So alſo in this part of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, their Service of God in his Ordinances; if the inſtitutions of Chriſt, and whatſoever hee in his Word hath preſcribed, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means, and circumſtances from more general Rules bee obſerved, by Miniſters that are gifted, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, and gracious, you will have a natural, free, and comely unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170378:36"/>
and more to the glory of God, then to have all by external injunctions, caſt as it were in an artificial mould; ſuch a forced Conformity in all Ages hath been the occaſion of greateſt differences and diſturbances; I ſay, the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Scripture Rules, which guide and direct an uniformity in matters of ſubſtance and greater conſequence, and by Canons and Injunctions erect an uniformity in matters of doubtful Diſpute, and not of much concernment if they were cleared. Thoſe Reverend <hi>N. Conformiſts</hi> that wrote the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition ſpoke very prudently to this; <hi>The only cauſe why our Church differeth from the Churches reformed of the Strangers, or among our ſelves, or they among themſelves is, becauſe our Church ſuffereth not it ſelf ſo to bee directed by the courſe of thoſe Scriptures as another doth, except it be in thoſe things of order, wherein one Pariſh may many times differ from
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170378:36"/>
another without offence, following the general Rules of Scripture for order, as in appointing time, place, and the like,</hi> 2 Ad. pa. 42. The pretence of uniformity, and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count taking liberty to impoſe doubtful Traditions, hath been in all Ages an Utenſile in the hands of Church Governours, by which they have exerciſed the greateſt tyranny, and put themſelves in a capacity to bring Miniſters under what bondage they pleaſe. One <hi>Councel</hi> Decrees, that <hi>all Miniſters must live ſingle lives,</hi> for unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> diſputes <hi>to have the Service in the ſame Language</hi> in all the Popes Dominions for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities ſake, and what thing, be it ever ſo abſurd but may bee brought into this Liſt. Where Councels or Convocations have a minde to bee rid of thoſe, of more conſcientious and uncomplying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits (tempting them by this means to that which they will call Schiſme

                  <p>Ob. 6. <hi>Wee are bound by</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>to uniformity in the Worſhip and Service of God, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to an uniformity in Catechiſing.</hi>

               <p>SUch an impoſition of a ſet Catechiſme, cannot bee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto, and our Chriſtian Liberty preſerved. This was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Argument, brought by our ſuffering Brethren againſt former impoſitions, in the Worſhip of God in the Epiſcopal times. How much wee ought to ſtand for the preſervation of ſuch a Liberty they declare from theſe following Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Galath.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.20, 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. and the like.</p>

                  <p>For further explication of this argument. The reverend Divines of the Aſſembly in their Preface to the Directory for worſhip, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves thus; <hi>Our care hath been to hold forth,</hi> 1. <hi>Such things as are of Divine inſtitution in every Ordinance.</hi> 2. <hi>And other things wee have endeavoured to ſet forth, according to the rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prudence agreeable to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rules of the Word of God.</hi> To theſe two heads therefore in their opinion, the ſubſtance of what Church Governours have either to injoyne, or commend in the Worſhip of God may bee redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
                  <p>For the former, It will I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe bee granted, as wee have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready endeavoured to prove, the particular Catechiſme, or any one forme for method and words is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170378:41"/>
not of an expreſs inſtitution; for if it were, it ought to be the ſame in all Churches, and Ages. For the ſecond, it is of ſuch things or circumſtances of Worſhip, as are not abſolutely neceſſary, but (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with what is expreſly inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted) <hi>indifferent</hi> only. This I ſuppoſe to be Mr. <hi>B.</hi> meaning in what hee ſpeaks of ſet Formes of Prayer. <hi>It is granted,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. p. 4</note> 
                     <hi>that no ſet forme of Prayer, or Liturgy it ſimply neceſſary either in publick or private, for then our Saviour Chriſt would by his Apostles have</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſet downe ſuch a one for an exact rule to all Chriſtians and Churches.</hi> And the like may wee ſay, in the words of Reverend Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Anſwer to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> p. 3</note> of ſet formes of Catechiſing, <hi>To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe and preſcribe,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>a ſet Forme of words, wherein all the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and anſwers ſhall run, and no other, wee know no warrant for that from Scripture. If God would have his people limited to a ſet forms of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170378:42"/>
words in Catechiſing, he would him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf have preſcribed ſome ſet forme of his owne inſpiration, which might be defective in no Principles, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious in any expreſsion.</hi> This Catechiſme then, or any the like, are of no other conſideration as a Catechiſme, or peculiar forme or method of inſtructing, but as ſuch things which are of an indifferent nature (according to the vulgar uſe of the word) and left to Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the general rules of Scripture, for particular determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in practice.</p>
                  <p>Now as Church Governours ought not by a Law to inſtitute or make ſacred, what the Lord hath not conſecrated by ſome word of inſtitution; ſo where the Lord hath left any matters common, or indifferent in Worſhip, wee muſt not impoſe them as neceſſary; for as the former is againſt Chriſtian Piety, ſo is this againſt Chriſtian Liberty. Two particulars here will
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170378:42"/>
need further explaining, 1. What is meant by things indifferent. 2. What by Chriſtian Liberty.</p>

I am conſtrained to doe otherwiſe in the Service and Worſhip of God, then in prudence or conſcience I judge my ſelf bound to doe, if there were no ſuch precept or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of man.

This our brethren judged againſt their Chriſtian Liberty, ſo though the reading of one Chapter in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, may be as edifying as another, and <hi>all Scripture is profitable,</hi> and ought to be read in publike, but to have the chapter for each day im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, to bee read and no other, is one reaſon our Brethren oppoſed the Common-prayer book.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 For the <hi>Matter,</hi> 1 There are divers Miniſters of piety and worth, and ſuch as the preſent eſtabliſhment alloweth as publike preachers that cannot teach or urge others to beleeve that infants are to bee baptiſed. There are alſo ſome other, the like doubtfull and diſputable points, which we are ingaged to teach or quit our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. He that hath the charge of ſoules may not upon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration teach another the leaſt matter that hee beleeves not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.19</note> ſo that ſuch have not liberty to inſtruct and teach what accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their conſciences is judged truth.</p>

and was to bee enjoyned as ſuch, for a man may bee ſaved that aſſents not to, nor beleeves many particulars laid down in that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme.</p>
                  <p>Again, do but compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. the latter end with chap. 6. &amp;c. where is laid down what is fit do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, or matter for ſuch inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you will finde this Catechiſm nothing according to that directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. There are not higher truths and ſtronger meat through out the whole Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> or any other Scriptures than neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily muſt bee explained and taught, for the underſtanding this Catechiſme, which will eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear if you do but read over the former part of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Though it were both ſound and ſutable, yet it is not Scripture, its not of <hi>divine inſpiration,</hi> its from a private or common gift, and therefore not to bee of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like interpretation. It is to bring

                  <p n="1">1 The reading inſtructions out of a Book, or learning and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by rote, is ſo dead and flat, as ſome godly Miniſters have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen (as more edifying;) firſt, to Preach principles and theſe funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental truths, in a more ſtirring and awakning way, as other truths; and then going over the Heads of ſuch a Sermon by queſtions, as Chriſt often dealt with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples after hee had preached,<note place="margin">Act. 8</note> and <hi>Philip</hi> with the Eunuch. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo inſtructed the ignorant,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.25</note> as a ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring efficacy did accompany, his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170378:49"/>
delivering theſe truths even to the converſion of ſuch as heard him.</p>
                  <p>Our brethren under Epiſcopacy in like manner ſcrupled, as in their <hi>admonition. Faith</hi> ſay they <hi>cometh by Preaching,</hi> Rom. 10. <hi>and not by reading</hi> in an ordinary way, <hi>it is not ſo much praying as ſaying a prayer, when it is read off from a book, nor ſo much preaching,</hi> or Catechizing as <hi>ſaying a Sermon,</hi> a Catechiſme when all is thus done by book.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Some have conceived it moſt to edification, to lay down the principles as ſo many diſtinct The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis or Doctrines one after another, without the forming or interpoſing any ſuch leading queſtion. So Mr. <hi>Nicholas Bifield</hi> in his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſtical Doctrin and others, there is a Catechiſme Printed <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.</hi> 1649. in this method, and in the preface, a perferring it before any other: as alſo the blame of ſet queſtions.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:170378:50"/>3 Mr. <hi>Herbert Palmer,</hi> a holy faithful Paſtor, found it by much experience to bee the beſt way to inſtruct his people, by forming two ſorts of queſtions with two ſorts of Anſwers, whereof the one is a bare affirmative, or Negative, <hi>yea</hi> or <hi>no;</hi> conceiving the ordinary way <hi>not ſufficient to drop knowledge into narrow mouthed veſſels</hi> (as in his preface) <hi>I. W.</hi> now a publike profeſſor in <hi>Oxford</hi> being of the ſame Opinion, beſtowed the pains to put the matter of this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Catechiſme into that form, and Printed it <hi>Anno</hi> 1649. who in his Epiſtle to the Reader tells us, this method is of more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Learned than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both in reſpect of memory and clearneſs of underſtanding the truths in the Catechiſme.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 A Godly induſtrious Miniſter, lately compoſed a Catechiſme, in which the childe or learner asked the queſtions, and the Miniſter or

                  <p n="6">6 The length and ſhortneſs of a Catechiſme ought to be regarded according to the ſtate of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we have to doe with. To that

                  <p>If conſcientiouſly a Miniſter that hath the Charge of Souls bee perſwaded, this forme or method of the Aſſembly bee not ſufficient, as Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> in his Preface, or not ſo edifying (as others) at leaſt for the people of my charge.

which is a greater bondage. The methods, and formes, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Worſhip, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chriſt, which are left free by him, ought to remaine free, and in our Miniſtry we ought to doe no more, or otherwiſe in this kinde at the command of Church Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, then in prudence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience wee judge our ſelves bound to doe if there were no command; where Chriſt hath left a liberty there needs a liberty; though the impoſition of ſome one forme may be ſutable to ſome few, yet the ſame if impoſed upon all, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come prejudicial to many.

                  <p>If nothing faulty either in the matter or forme of this Catechiſm, yet wee enjoy not that miniſterial li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty Chriſt hath left us, and that which hitherto, and even in the worſt times hath bin enjoyed in this Nation, and hitherto we have not beene ſtraightned or narrowed. It is true, a forme of Catechiſme is mentioned in the Common Prayer-book, but ſo as a liberty left, and taken to compoſe, or chuſe what Catechiſme a man judged more ſutable to his people for their edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; and few Miniſters of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency in the Land but compoſed a diſtinct Catechiſme, there are I beleeve no leſs then five hundred ſeveral Catechiſmes extant; nay men of the Epiſcopal way, and ſuch as were punctual in obſerving the very hints of what was likely to be pleaſing or diſpleaſing to their

Lords, compoſed and publiſhed Catechiſmes for matter and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod differing from what was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by authority; as Doct. <hi>Hall,</hi> who was afterwards Biſhop, Dr. <hi>Featly,</hi> Dr. <hi>Chitwin,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hill,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pearſton,</hi> who dedicated his Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vicars</hi> Chap. to Biſhop <hi>Carl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and many others.</p>
                  <p>Neither hath this variety been looked upon as hurtful, for if ſo, then holy men would have kept to what they found, and have made conſcience of increaſing this evil by adding to the number; <hi>I finde</hi> (ſaith Dr. Gouge) <hi>in all ages of the Church,</hi>

to the Nation by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament then ſitting, and received and ſetled in <hi>Scotland;</hi> yet mens Conſciences have not been ſatisfied in this, as the only Catechiſme fit to bee uſed, as appeareth in the great number and variety of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſmes compoſed and printed ſince this was publiſhed, a greater number then in ſo ſhort a time were ever publiſhed before.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe in all this variety of Catechiſmes there were no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, no one better, but each e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually as good, and edifying to my people as other; that which I now further aſſert is this, that in theſe Spiritual affaires, to impoſe or limit to ſome one in ſuch a caſe, is againſt Chriſtian Liberty, and our freedome as Miniſters; if a man hath obtained his Freedome in any Trade, hee is judged fit to ſet up in any part of the City, no man can limit him to any one Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct, though hee might drive his

Trade with as much advantage there as in any other place; nay, if a man ſhall enter into Bond to his Maſter not to ſet up his Trade in ſuch a ſtreet, or within ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from him, this Bond is voyd in Law, ſo tender are our Lawes of Humane liberty.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> ſo tearmed, is beyond Controverſie, as edifying as any other Prayer in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet our Brethren the <hi>N.

                  <p>The third particular by which in ſuch impoſitions wee are abridged of our Liberty, it is in reſpect of the gifts and abilities wee have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Chriſt.

                  <p>This muſt needes bring a low e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem upon this way, eſpecially when ſo many other <hi>Callings</hi> and imployments are in our eye, more illuſtrious and creditful, and may bee undertook, and continued in, with much more ſecurity; The <hi>Law, Phyſick, Merchandize, &amp;c.</hi> Callings much more gainful, and may bee had, and practiſed by a <hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Papiſt,</hi> here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; nor is there any thing

in point of Religion or Morals more required of them in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, than in the holding of their Houſes, Lands, or Temporal eſtates.</p>
                  <p>And let not men deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in thinking, that this Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hath ſuch a <hi>peculiar ſweetneſſe,</hi> and ſuch encouragements from the Lord, more than other Callings, that there is no fear wee ſhall want Miniſters; Or that the men of this Calling ſhould bee ſo Spiritual, as <hi>revenues</hi> or <hi>reward</hi> in theſe tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and carnal things, ſhould, or ought not to be reſpected by them.</p>

                  <p>When men take the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the calling, they purpoſe themſelves unto, it is at a diſtance, and after this reſolution is taken up (which is but the firſt ſtep) there is a tedious journey to bee made through ſome years educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo that the moſt men that now are in this, or in moſt other cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, are ſuch who were in their

Natural ſtate and condition, when they firſt choſe and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their way. And made their choyce with reſpect rather to a <hi>livelihood,</hi> and ſupport in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things; ſome to raiſe an eſtate, &amp;c. than any thing of more Spiritual conſideration: As the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>plenty</hi> in his Fathers houſe was to that Son (in the place and diſtance in which hee ſtood) the <hi>firſt,</hi> if not the greateſt <hi>motive,</hi>

                  <p>But let Gods dealing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in removing of them, bee remarkably obſerved, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in this, namely, That when the Lord took from this <hi>Tribe</hi> thoſe <hi>invitations,</hi> that did ballance the hazard of a long and chargeable education, and other uncertainties, At the ſame time theſe Ceremonies and ſubſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (the tenure by which they were held) and thoſe great and breaking penalties of <hi>ejection</hi> and <hi>deprivation</hi> for Non-Conformity were alſo happily removed; which was ſo great an incouragement on the other hand; as it held up mens minds to the Miniſtry notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>

                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:170378:85"/>But now to ſee theſe <hi>penalties,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one occaſion or other, <hi>returning</hi> upon us again (but thoſe <hi>encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements,</hi> or any equivalent, never likely to return) and that after they have been ſo lately, and <hi>twice</hi> taken away, and to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in as ſtrict a ſeverity upon this almoſt <hi>ſunk</hi> generation of men as ever they were inflicted; It will cauſe multitudes to turn their backs upon <hi>this Profeſsion</hi> more than upon any other; and more than ever they have done heretofore.</p>
                  <p>I muſt profeſſe, I <hi>have long</hi> feared, and doe ſtill more than ever, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>theſe things,</hi> and upon what uncertain terms alſo, that <hi>mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> depends, which the Law hath allowed for the Miniſters ſupport, and how long <hi>ſtruck</hi> at (I mean Tithes) and <hi>petitioned</hi> againſt, and I doubt had been taken away before this time, were it not for the <hi>Lay-intereſt</hi> (ſo much ſpoken againſt by ſome) of <hi>Appropriators.</hi>

                  <p>For the firſt, when a reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made, of what is amiſſe in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; when the Worſhip of God comes to bee <hi>purged</hi> of old <hi>wonts</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtitions,</hi> theſe are ſuch things as the common people are more unwilling to part with than

                  <p>The Miniſters they only ſtand as it were in the <hi>front</hi> of contention, and receive all the <hi>ſhot</hi> of oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:170378:87"/>When Miniſters had to doe only with the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Goſpel, and diſcharged their Conſciences in a faithful and ſearching application of it to each perſon, ſuch a mans condition was not much better than <hi>Iſhmaels,</hi> of whom it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 16.12</note>

                  <p>Thus we ſee Miniſters have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements enough at ſuch a time, from the work it ſelf if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as it ſhould be, in ſo much

                  <p>For the Second. As the work it ſelf hath not been ſo troubleſome
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170378:89"/>
and diſcouraging, in any age: ſo is this a ſeaſon wherein the faithful Orthodox Labourers are <hi>few,</hi> very few in compariſon. The age before this late Reformation, was a very <hi>waſting</hi> age, by reaſon of Epiſcopal tyranny, many that were conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diverted their Studies; of thoſe that engaged in the Miniſtry, multitudes were hunted out of this Nation into forein parts, where half of them loſt their laſt breath, and not half of that half remaining, are returned amongſt us again.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo with us now, as in the firſt reformation, the <hi>Popiſh</hi> then ſo the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> diſ-affected Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters now, have neceſſarily been tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of this imployment: ſo that ſuch is the ſcarcity of well-affected and able men to carry on this work, that many Pariſhes throughout the Nation lye vacant, and are as ſheep without a Shepheard; eſpecially in the remoter parts. And where it is otherwiſe, and places better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170378:89"/>
the number is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, no not in the City of <hi>London,</hi> or the <hi>Univerſities,</hi> to preſerve their people to the intreſt of the preſent work of Chriſt: but are more and more prevailed upon, and infected with the old Leaven of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Superſtition, and the wretched Principles of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal malignant Party, which daily increaſeth every where.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon of ſuch <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> I conceive to be this. Many ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and ill-affected, ſtill hold their places and Livings, by the intreſt of friends, or having been <hi>wary,</hi> and kept without the reach of the Ordinance; and thoſe more <hi>open</hi> who have been ejected, creep into the empty and vacant places, and having no legal maintenance are not (nor are the people that receive and maintain them) within the reach of any Law as yet eſtabliſhed: ſo that it is to be feared, ſuch perſons up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one account or other, are a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170378:90"/>
number than the ſound and godly, and thoſe that ingage tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly in this work.</p>
                  <p>This being ſo, the faithful and well-affected Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſhould not at ſuch a time eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, but for very great unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, be ejected and put out of their places.

                  <p>Our adverſaries never have ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the different opinions or practices that are amongſt our ſelves, as when for ſuch differences wee drive one another out of the field. Though differences are and have bin between Presbyterians and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170378:91"/>
Independents, yet each keeps his ſtation, and fights (in different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, it may bee) againſt the ſame common Enemy. But by ſuch penalties of <hi>ejection</hi> and <hi>ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing;</hi> we drive a conſiderable <hi>part</hi> of our own out from us, when our common enemy is already too ſtrong for the whole. The Popiſh party had no ſuch advantage by any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences amongſt thoſe that oppoſed them, in the firſt reformation, as when the brethren ſo differing came by the <hi>ſeverity</hi> of Governours, to bee diſtinguiſhed by the ſir-names of <hi>Conformiſts</hi> and <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> and the one upon that account <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiered</hi> and droven out of the <hi>field</hi> by the other.</p>
                  <p>And I have been very apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, this to be the cauſe why that firſt reformation proſpered no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: we know that in near a hundred years it gained little upon <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> more than was got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the firſt aſſault, nay it <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed,</hi>

and Popery grew under it ſo faſt, as at laſt wee were almoſt returned into the ſame condition that we were reformed from; this I ſay may be the cauſe. There was the like ſevere impoſitions and Lawes made (as in <hi>this caſe</hi>) upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of differences amongſt themſelvs, and then advantages were taken thereby, and many put out of the Muſter-roll, for <hi>Non-Conformity,</hi> who were of greateſt courage, and moſt faithful reſolution againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Superſtition, the then common enemy.</p>

                  <p>And we have been poſſeſſed now ſome years with the ſweet fruition of <hi>that</hi> liberty, thoſe our Brethren <hi>ſaw only afarre of, rejoycing</hi> in the <hi>hopes</hi> of it, and ſo fell aſleep

in the Lord. I ſay, to ſuffer our ſelves again to bee brought into bondage, and not to ſtirre and doe our duty, and what belongs to each in our places for the preventing hereof, is to degenerate in reſpect of the courage our Fathers had for the Lord in their times. Had they prevailed for themſelves, by their conteſts with the Epiſcopal party, and enjoyed ten or twelve years freedom as grear, or greater than was hoped for; and taſted the ſweetneſſe of it in the purity of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances for ſuch a time: would they have been the <hi>more,</hi> or <hi>leſſe</hi> patient in being brought again to their former thraldome? Can any reaſonable man imagine then, that the returning of like <hi>impoſitions</hi> in as great <hi>ſeverity</hi> again as ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and for the like matters, will not occaſion greater contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and differences, Schiſms, and diſtractions amongſt the people of God, than ever was heretofore;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170378:109"/>
eſpecially when beſides Scripture-light, that laies it upon our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences thus to <hi>contend,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jude 3.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170378:109"/>
an eaſier and quieter mind, dwell in a houſe of bondage again: than their predeceſſors, that never had a taſt of ſuch manifeſtations of the Lord, in owning his oppreſſed ones, as we have had in theſe late years.</p>

                  <p>
                     <q>I put great difference between <hi>Quod liceat,</hi> and <hi>Quid expediat,</hi> and likewiſe between them that are Schiſmatical, or open diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the State Eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhed, and them that are <hi>ſcrupulous only</hi> upon ſome Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and other Circumſtances,

                  <p>
                     <q>Concerning thoſe Preachers laſt mentioned, I ſuppoſe that if upon urging of them to the uſe of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>attire preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,</hi> they ſhould ſtand out ſtifly, and chuſe rather to forgoe their Livings, and the exerciſe of their Miniſtery, and though I doe not juſtifie their doings therein, yet ſurely their <hi>ſervice</hi> would be <hi>miſſed,</hi> at ſuch <hi>time,</hi> as need ſhall require them and us, to give the right hand of fellowſhip one to another, and to goe arme in arme againſt the <hi>Common Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,</hi> that ſo there might bee, <hi>Vis unita fortior.</hi> In which caſe of want of their joynt labours with ours, there might ariſe cauſe of ſome ſuch <hi>doleful complaint,</hi> as fell out upon an accident of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

nature in the Book of <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.15. where it is ſaid, that <hi>for the diviſions of</hi> Reuben <hi>there were great thoughts of heart.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Alſo remember,<note place="margin">Judg. 20.12, 13, 14.46, 47, &amp; 21.1.6. &amp;c.</note> that when the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> though for their deſert in maintaining of a bad cauſe were all deſtroyed ſaving ſix hundred, and the men of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſware in their fury,</hi> that none of them would give his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Benjamites</hi> to Wife, yet when their <hi>hot bloud</hi> was over, they lamented, and ſaid, <hi>There is one Tribe cut off from Iſrael this day,</hi> and they uſed all their <hi>wits</hi> to the uttermoſt of their policy to reſtore that <hi>Tribe</hi> again. In like ſort, if theſe our Brethren a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid ſhould bee <hi>deprived</hi> of their places for the <hi>matters</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, I think wee ſhould finde cauſe to bend our wits to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt extent of our skill to <hi>provide</hi> ſome Cure of Souls for them, where they may <hi>exerciſe</hi> their talents.</q>

                     <q>Furthermore, if theſe men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>divers hundreds</hi> (as it is brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted abroad) ſhould forſake their <hi>Charges</hi> (as ſome doe preſuppoſe they will) who I pray you ſhould <hi>ſucceed</hi> them? Verily I know not where to finde ſo many able Preachers within this Realm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided for. But be it that ſo many may bee found to ſupply thoſe empty roomes, yet they might more conveniently bee ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Seates of <hi>unpreaching</hi> Miniſters, and ſo the number of Preachers ſhould be much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But if they ſhould bee put into the <hi>places</hi> of <hi>theſe men</hi> being <hi>diſpoſſeſſed,</hi> thereupon would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; Firſt, That the number of preaching Incumbents ſhould not be multiplied by their ſupply; and Secondly, The Churches could not in likelihood be ſo <hi>well</hi> and <hi>fitly</hi> furniſhed on the ſuddain; for that though happily the new ſupply ſhould bee of men as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170378:114"/>
as the former, yet is it not probable that they ſhould bee at their firſt coming from the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, or in a good while after, ſo <hi>ready Preachers,</hi> ſo experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>in Paſtoral Government,</hi> ſo well acquainted with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and uſage of the people, and ſo <hi>diſcreet</hi> every way in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of themſelves, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who have ſpent already <hi>many years</hi> abroad in their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial charges. Beſides this, for ſo much as in the life time of the late Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> theſe things were not <hi>ſo extreamly urged,</hi> but that many learned Preachers enjoyed <hi>their liberty</hi> herein, conditionally that they did not by word or deed openly diſgrace, or diſturb the State e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed; I would know a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why it ſhould <hi>now</hi> be ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally and exceeding ſtrictly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon, eſpecially ſeeing that thoſe men are now the more

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170378:122"/>
Civil Magiſtrate: it is difficult, if not impoſſible, in an ordinary way, to get any thing reformed; though it bee ever ſo inconvenient, and burdenſome to mens Conſciences. <hi>Repeals</hi> and changes are made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of Lawes about <hi>Civil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,</hi> and our evils cured as they come to bee diſcerned: but <hi>Church</hi> grievances, like diſeaſes in the ſpirits, are in a manner incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 1 There are but a <hi>few</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, and thoſe more <hi>ſtrict</hi> and conſcientious (who are ordinarily the worſt beloved, and leaſt regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) that feel the pain of ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers. 2 By ſuch impoſitions we rid our ſelves of thoſe Miniſters, whom wee eſteem moſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; and have great advantage to faſhion, the reſt (I mean the leſs conſcientious) to a ſtate guiſe. The ſad experience we have had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and what great and conſtant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours after reformation have been many years proſecuted, with
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170378:122"/>
little or no fruit, may be a proof ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient hereof.</p>
               <p>In the Reformation began with <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, ſuch <hi>reliques of Popery</hi> were left in the Church, as did much <hi>offend</hi> divers godly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, even in thoſe dayes. Theſe <hi>Superſtitions</hi> coming to a <hi>ſettlement,</hi> and by penal Lawes <hi>fixed</hi> in the Worſhip and Service of God, they held their ſtation neer a <hi>hundred years,</hi> notwithſtanding the <hi>teſtimonies</hi> at ſeveral times given all along a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.

and witneſſings did not in the leaſt <hi>looſen</hi> the hold thoſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had gotten by their firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, but were continued ſtill, as will appear in what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
